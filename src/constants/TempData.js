This would help to read the world sport news in the original without difficulty, communicate with your foreign peers, and understand English-speaking sports commentators. It is easy to remember the names of principal athletic disciplines in English. The most of the words adopted by the Russian language in their original phonetic form represent a linguistic calque. For example, football, basketball, volleyball, tennis. There are, however, certain linguistic features in the names of plays or areas that are specific to the spoken language of Brits, Canadians, Americans, Australians, and people of other English-speaking countries. The popularity of a particular discipline and its name variant also depend on the country (there are exclusively British and American sports). In the US, football is mostly called soccer, while in the UK the name is football. The sports that are loved in the UK are handball (гандбол), fencing (фехтование), cricket (крикет), chess (шахматы), rowing (гребля), golf (гольф), etc. Let us learn what are the names of various sports in English and their translation. Now, as you have familiarized with the primary sports terms, you can make exercises to remember them and have more practice. If you want to learn the English language in depth with fun and communicate on various specific topics, CIS International School can help you with that. Call us 012365874953 and learn more about the application procedure, programs offered by the School, and the prospects of success that the students of the School would have in life.
